BURN IT DOWN,Linkin Park,selfdetermination,True,1346,"The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down

And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

You told me yes, you held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn (Burn)

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn (Burn)
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn (Burn)
We can't wait to burn it to the ground"
Fireflies,Owl City,selfdetermination,True,1766,"You would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude, but I would just stand and stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head, a sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep?

To ten million fireflies, I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (They said farewell)
But I'll know where several are if my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (Jar, jar, jar)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams"
21 Guns,Green Day,perseverance,True,1279,"Do you know what's worth fightin' for
When it's not worth dyin' for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocatin'?
Does the pain weigh out the pride
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?


When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Somethin' inside this heart has died
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I"
Numb,Linkin Park,selfdetermination,True,1451,"I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be"
CASTLE OF GLASS,Linkin Park,selfdetermination,True,795,"Take me down to the river bend
Take me down to the fighting end
Wash the poison from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again
Fly me up on a silver wing
Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm me up in a nova's glow
And drop me down to the dream below

'Cause I'm only a crack
In this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

Bring me home in a blinding dream
Through the secrets that I have seen
Wash the sorrow from off my skin
And show me how to be whole again

'Cause I'm only a crack
In this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

'Cause I'm only a crack
In this castle of glass
Hardly anything else I need to be

'Cause I'm only a crack
In this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see, for you to see"
Boulevard of Broken Dreams,Green Day,selfdetermination,True,1341,"I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone

I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, and I walk a—

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beatin'
Sometimes, I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then, I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I'm walkin' down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone

I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, and I walk a—

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beatin'
Sometimes, I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then, I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

Chill out, whatcha yellin' for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be
You will see
I like you the way you are
When we're drivin' in your car
And you're talkin' to me
One-on-one, but you become

Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryna be cool
You look like a fool to me, tell me

Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Actin' like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you
You fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get and you turn it into
Honesty, and promise me, I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no

You come over unannounced
Dressed up like you're somethin' else
Where you are ain't where it's at

Laugh out when you strike your pose
Take off all your preppy clothes
You know, you're not foolin'

Holiday,Green Day,selfdetermination,True,1335,"Say, hey, cha

Hear the sound of the fallin' rain
Comin' down like an Armageddon flame (Hey)
The shame, the ones who died without a name
Hear the dogs howlin' out of key
To a hymn called ""Faith and Misery"" (Hey)
And bleed, the company lost the war today

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday

Hear the drum poundin' out of time
Another protester has crossed the line (Hey)
To find the money's on the other side
Can I get another Amen? (Amen)
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday

(Hey)


(Three, four)
The representative from California has the floor

Sieg Heil to the President Gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel Towers
Who criticize your government
Bang-bang goes the broken glass, and
Kill all the fags that don't agree
Trials by fire, settin' fire
Is not a way that's meant for me
Just 'cause (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Just 'cause, because we're outlaws, yeah (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
This is our lives on holiday"

All the things she said, all the things she said
Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head
All the things she said (All the things she said)
This is not enough
 (
Enough, enough, enough
)

I'm in serious shit, I feel totally lost
If I'm asking for help, it's only because
Being with you has opened my eyes
Could I ever believe such a perfect surprise?
I keep asking myself, wondering how
I keep closing my eyes, but I can't block you out
Wanna fly to a place where it's just you and me
Nobody else, so we can be free

And I'm all mixed up, feeling cornered and rushed
They say it's my fault, but I want her so much
Wanna fly her away where the sun and rain
Come in over my face, wash away all the shame
When they stop and stare, don't worry me
'Cause I'm feeling for her what she's feeling for me
I can try to pretend, I can try to forget
But it's driving me mad, going out of my head

All the things she said, all the things she said

Teenage Dirtbag,Wheatus,lovemaking,True,1228,"Her name is Noelle, I have a dream about her
She rings my bell, I got gym class in half an hour
Oh, how she rocks in Keds and tube socks
But she doesn't know who I am, and she doesn't give a damn about me

'Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
Yeah, I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
Listen to Iron Maiden, baby, with me, ooh

Her boyfriend's a dick and he brings a gun to school
And he'd simply kick my ass if he knew the truth
He lives on my block, and he drives an IROC
But he doesn't know who I am, and he doesn't give a damn about me

'Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
Yeah, I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
Listen to Iron Maiden, baby, with me, ooh

Oh, yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missin'
Oh, yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missin'

Man, I feel like mold, it's prom night and I am lonely
Lo and behold, she's walkin' over to me
This must be fake, my lip starts to shake
How does she know who I am? And why does she give a damn about me?

I've got two tickets to Iron Maiden, baby
Come with me Friday, don't say maybe
I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby, like you, ooh

Oh, yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missin'

Stereo Hearts,Gym Class Heroes,lovemaking,True,3061,"My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote
Make me your radio (Yeah, ha)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you (Right there)
To sing along to my stereo (Gym Class Heroes, baby!)

If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like yikky-yeah check it, Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I’d sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you (Uh-ha-ha)

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no— (Yeah)

This melody was meant for you
To sing along to my stereo

Oh, oh oh-oh, oh
Oh oh-oh (To my stereo)
Oh, oh-oh, oh
To sing along to my stereo
Let's go!

If I was an old-school, fifty-pound boombox (Remember them?)
Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (Turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop (Peace)
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate (Never know)

I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you could hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you (Uh-ha-ha)

My heart's a stereo (Yeah)
It beats for you, so listen close (Listen)
Hear my thoughts in every no—

Oh, oh oh-oh, oh (Yeah)
Oh oh-oh (To my stereo)
Oh, oh-oh, oh
To sing along to my stereo (Sing along, sing along)

I only pray you never leave me behind (Never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (So hard to find)
I'll take your hand and hold it closer to mine (Yeah)
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind (Yeah, yeah, come on, ooh)

My heart's a stereo (Yeah)
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no—

In the End,Linkin Park,perseverance,True,1820,"It starts with one

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time, all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, 
it's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter"

Gives You Hell,All-American-Rejects,selfdetermination,True,2236,"I wake up every evenin'
With a big smile on my face

At a 9 to 5 pace
I wonder how bad that tastes

When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

Now where's your picket fence, love?
And where's that shiny car?
And did it ever get you far?
You never seemed so tense, love
I've never seen you fall so hard
Do you know where you are?

And truth be told, I miss you
And truth be told, I'm lyin'

When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell
I hope it gives you hell

Tomorrow, you'll be thinkin' to yourself

When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell

Now you'll never see what you've done to me
You can take back your memories, they're no good to me
And here's all your lies, you can look me in the eyes
With the sad, sad look that you wear so well

(When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell)

When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell!)
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)
When you hear this song and you sing along, no, you'll never tell (No, you'll never tell)
Then you're the fool, I'm just as well, hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)

Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill

But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and
The light that you shine can't be seen?

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
Ooh, the more I get of you, stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the grey

Ba-ya-ya, ba-da-da-da-da-da, ba-ya-ya
Ba-ya-ya, ba-da-da-da-da-da, ba-ya-ya

There is so much a man can tell you
So much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain, baby
To me, you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny
Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?

But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and
The light that you shine can't be seen?

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
Ooh, the more I get of you, stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the grey

I've been kissed by a rose on the grey
I, I've been kissed by a rose on the grey
I've (And if I should fall, will it all go away?) been kissed by a rose on the grey

Let Her Go,Passenger,heartbroken,True,1977,"Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well, you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go, oh, woah, mm, oh
And you let her go, oh, woah, uh, no
Well, you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go"

Turn Off The Light,Nelly Furtado,heartbroken,True,2596,"It's getting so lonely inside this bed

She’s a Maniac,Phone Calls From Home,selfdetermination,True,1417,"Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night
Looking for the fight of her life
In the real time world no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy
Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart
Changing moment into light
She has danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance
It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
All the while you're stuck between
What's will and what will be
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she never danced before
On the ice filled line of sanity
It's a place most never see
It's a hard won place of mystery
You can touch it but can't hold it
You work all your life for that moment in time
It can come or pass you by
It's a push of the world but there's always a chance
If the hunger stays alive
There's a cold kinetic heat
Struggling, stretching for the beat
Never stopping
With her hair against the wind
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she never danced before
It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
All the while you're stuck between
What's will and what will be
She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she never danced before"

Knew a better life existed, but thought that I missed it
My lifestyle's wild, I was livin' like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash, paroled the police files

I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead
You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see, it don't get better than this

Everytime We Touch,Cascada,lovemaking,True,1182,"I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me
I still feel your touch in my dream (In my dream)
Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why
Without you, it's hard to survive

'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling
And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last
Need you by my side
'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static
And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go
Want you in my life


Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky
They wipe away tears that I cry (That I cry)
The good and the bad times, we've been through them all
You make me rise when I fall

Somebody That I Used To Know,Gotye,heartbroken,True,1864,"Now and then, I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy, you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember


You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that, though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know


Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing (Ah)
And I don't even need your love (Ohh)
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough (Ah)
No, you didn't have to stoop so low (Ohh)
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number (Ah)
I guess that I don't need that, though (Ohh)

Fire Coming out of the Monkey’s Head,Gorillaz,aggressive,True,2166,"Once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain
There was a town where the people known as Happyfolk lived
Their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world
Obscured as it was by great clouds
Here, they played out their peaceful lives
Innocent of the litany of excess and violence
That was growing in the world below
To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough
Then one day, Strangefolk arrived in the town
They came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses
But no one noticed them, they only saw shadows
You see, without the Truth of the Eyes, the Happyfolk were blind

Falling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes
Waiting for the sunset to come, people going home
Jump out from behind them and shoot them in the head
Now everybody dancing, the dance of the dead
The dance of the dead, the dance of the dead

In time, the Strangefolk found their way into the higher reaches of the mountain
And it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable sincerity and beauty
By chance, they stumbled upon the place where all good souls come to rest
The Strangefolk, they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things
And soon they began to mine the mountain
Its rich seam, fueling the chaos of their own world
Meanwhile, down in the town, the Happyfolk slept restlessly
Their dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls
Every day, people would wake and stare at the mountain
Why was it bringing darkness into their lives?
And as the Strangefolk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain, holes began to appear
Bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the Monkey
For the first time, the Happyfolk felt fearful
For they knew that soon the Monkey would stir from its deep sleep
And then came a sound, distant first, that grew into castrophany
So immense that it could be heard far away in space
There were no screams, there was no time
The mountain called Monkey had spoken
There was only fire, and then... nothing

Oh, little town in the USA, your time has come to see
There's nothing you believe you want
But where were you when it all came down on me?
Did you call me? No"

Fairytale Gone Bad,Sunrise Avenue,heartbroken,True,1516,"This is the end, you know
Lady, the plans we had went all wrong
We ain't nothing but fight and shout and tears
We got to a point I can't stand
I've had it to the limit, I can't be your man
I ain't more than a minute away from walking

We can't cry the pain away
We can't find a need to stay
I slowly realize there's nothing on our side

Out of my life, out of my mind
Out of the tears we can't deny
We need to swallow all our pride
And leave this mess behind
Out of my head, out of my bed
Out of the dreams we had, they're bad
Tell them it's me who made you sad
Tell them the fairytale gone bad

Another night and I bleed
They all make mistakes and so did we
But we did something we can never turn back right
Find a new one to fool
Leave and don't look back, I won't follow
We have nothing left, it's the end of our time

We can't cry the pain away
We can't find a need to stay
There's no more rabbits in my hat to make things right

Out of my life, out of my mind
Out of the tears we can't deny
We need to swallow all our pride
And leave this mess behind

Out of the dreams we had, they're bad

Can't find hope to believe in

Drop dead, a bullet to my head
Your words are like a gun in hand
You can't change the state of the nation
We just need some motivation
These eyes have seen no conviction
Just lies and more contradiction

I'd say it's time too late

So am I still waiting (So am I down?)
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason (So am I down?)

We're the first ones to jump in line
Out of step for what we believe in

How far will we take this?

You gave a promise to me, and I gave mine to you
I need someone beside me in everything I do
You know I love you I always will
My mind's made up by the way that I feel
There's no beginning, there'll be no end
'Cause on my love you can depend
It's written on the wind, it's everywhere I go
So if you really love me, come on and let it show
Come on and let it show"
Wake Me Up When September Ends,Green Day,loneliness,True,941,"Summer has come and passed

Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Ring out the bells again
Like we did when spring began
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost

The Nights,Avicii,selfdetermination,True,1554,"(Hey)

Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
(Hey) Went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

One day my father he told me
""Son, don't let it slip away""
He took me in his arms, I heard him say (Hey)
""When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid""

He said, ""One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember""

""These are the nights that never die""

(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)

(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)

When thunderclouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shining stars
He said, ""Go venture far beyond the shores
Don't forsake this life of yours
I'll guide you home no matter where you are""

One day my father, he told me
""Son, don't let it slip away""
When I was just a kid, I heard him say

You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there

I've gotta learn how to love without you
I've gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in a riddle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck, I'm going out without you
I'm gonna tear this city down without you
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you

Now I'm running away, my dear
From myself and the truth I fear
My heart is beating I can't see clear
How I'm wishing that you were here

Or return to where we were

And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door

Thank You,Dido,lovemaking,True,1085,"My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again
And even if I'm there, they'll all imply
That I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad
It's not so bad

And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life
And oh, just to be with you
Is having the best day of my life

Push the door, I'm home at last
And I'm soaking through and through
And then you handed me a towel
And all I see is you
And even if my house falls down now
I wouldn't have a clue
Because you're near me

And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life
And oh, just to be with you
Is having the best day of my life
And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life
And oh, just to be with you

Cortez The Killer,Neil Young,perseverance,True,896,"He came dancing across the water
With his galleons and guns
Looking for the new world
And that palace in the sun
On the shore lay Montezuma
With his coca leaves and pearls
In his halls, he often wandered
With the secrets of the world

And his subjects gathered 'round him
Like the leaves around a tree
In their clothes of many colors
For the angry gods to see
And the women all were beautiful
And the men stood straight and strong
They offered life in sacrifice
So that others could go on

Hate was just a legend
And war was never known
People worked together
And they lifted many stones
And they carried them to the flatlands
But they died along the way
And they built up with their bare hands
What we still can't do today

And I know she's living there
And she loves me to this day
I still can't remember when
Or how I lost my way

A touch of sable in their eyes

When's your daddy gonna talk to you?
But you were livin' in another world
Tryna get a message through

No one heard a single word you said
They shoulda seen it in your eyes
What was goin' 'round your head (Ooh-ooh)

Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway

Take a line every night, guaranteed to blow your mind
I see you out on the streets, callin' for a wild time
So you sit home alone, 'cause there's nothin' left that you can do
There's only pictures hung in the shadows left there to look at you

You know she likes the lights at night on the neon Broadway sign
She don't really mind, it's only love she hoped to find (Ooh-ooh)

Ooh, she's a little runaway

I need a room with new colours

Whatever it was, whatever it was

Her heat was amazing

Old ways, erased

Going To California,Led Zeppelin,selfdetermination,True,1052,"Spent my days with a woman unkind
Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going to California with an achin' in my heart
Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair

Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let 'em tell you that they're all the same
Oh, the sea was red and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
The children of the sun begin to awake (Watch out)

Seems that the wrath of the gods
Got a punch on the nose and it's startin' to flow
I think I might be sinkin'
Throw me a line, if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there
Where the path runs straight and high

To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings, ""La la la la""
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standin' on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Tellin' myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems (Mm, ah)

And disregards the rest, hmm

I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Runnin' scared, laying low
Seeking out the poorer quarters, where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie

Asking only workman's wages
I come lookin' for a job but I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on 7th Avenue
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there, la la la la la la la


Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie

And I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone
Goin' home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me
Going home

In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out in his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving"", but the fighter still remains

Brothers In Arms,Dire Straits,loneliness,True,733,"These mist covered mountains
Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be
Some day you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn
To be brothers in arms

Through these fields of destruction
Baptisms of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battle raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms

There's so many different worlds
So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones


Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die
But it's written in the starlight
And every line in your palm
We're fools to make war
On our brothers in arms"
A Horse With No Name,America,perseverance,True,1855,"On the first part of the journey
I was lookin' at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert, you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la
La, la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la

After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was lookin' at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead

You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert, you can remember your name
Because there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la
La, la, la la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la


After nine days, I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with its life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert, you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la

Year Of The Cat,Al Stewart,lovemaking,True,1198,"On a morning from a Bogart movie
In a country where they turn back time
You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre
Contemplating a crime
She comes out of the sun in a silk dress running
Like a watercolour in the rain
Don't bother asking for explanations
She'll just tell you that she came

In the year of the cat

She doesn't give you time for questions
As she locks up your arm in hers
And you follow till your sense of which direction
Completely disappears
By the blue tiled walls near the market stalls
There's a hidden door she leads you to
These days, she says, ""I feel my life!""
Just like a river running through

The year of the cat

Well, she looks at you so coolly
And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea
She comes in Incense and Patchouli
So, you take her to find what's waiting inside

The year of the cat


Well, morning comes and you're still with her
And the bus and the tourists are gone
And you've thrown away your choice and lost your ticket
So, you have to stay on
But, the drum beat strains of the night remain
In the rhythm of the new-born day
You know sometime you're bound to leave her
But, for now you're going to stay

In the year of the cat
Mm, year of the cat"

Sultans Of Swing,Dire Straits,perseverance,True,1389,"You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park, but meantime
South of the river, you stop
And you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie, double-four time
You feel alright when you hear that music ring

Well, now you step inside
But you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain
To hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
Ah, but the horns, they're blowing that sound

Way on down south
Way on down south, London town

You check out guitar George
He knows all the chords
Mind, it's strictly rhythm
He doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Yes and an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And Harry doesn't mind
If he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job
He's doing alright
He can play the honky-tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night

With the Sultans
With the Sultans of Swing
Yeah

And a crowd of young boys
They're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
And their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call Rock and Roll

And the Sultans
Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole
Creole


And then the man
He steps right up to the microphone
And says at last
Just as the time bell rings
“Goodnight, now it's time to go home”
Then he makes it fast with one more thing

“We are the Sultans
We are the Sultans of Swing”"

Time after

Sometimes you picture me, I'm walkin' too far ahead
You're callin' to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, ""Go slow"", I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, (I'll be waiting) I will be waiting

Watchin' through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting

The City Of New Orleans,Arlo Gutherie,loneliness,True,1698,"Riding on the City of New Orleans,
Illinois Central, Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields
Passin' trains that have no names
Freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles
Good morning, America, how are you?
So Don't you know me I'm your native son
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
Dealin' cards with the old men in the club car
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score
Won't you pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor
And the sons of Pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their fathers' magic carpets made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel
Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
Nighttime on The City of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea
And all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his songs again
The passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearing railroad blues
Good night, America, how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son

Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery

Different to the child with the smile in your photos
Made some decisions, some wrong, some right
Now strangers call my number when I'm sleeping at night
But they're sinners too
And they'll only make me worse
Don't let me go
And roll away like a penny down a hole in a road

Like a fallen angel
I seek refuge in the valley of lonesome souls
With tales told of those taken from those of broken homes
I smoke the chung while my heart bleeds burgundy
Stuck on the title page, still yearning to turn the sheet
Observing the worst deceit
This book of lies got me shook of life
Still picturing crooked ties
I must've mistook for right
Getting nicked again and again
Whether the venom is peng
It severs several levels in head
But for some reason, I'm several levels ahead of these
Sheep and cattle, wannabes, wannabe street and battle
But many die in war, that's a fact
In the pursuit of glory, men will attack intact no looking back
Bang!
That's the sound of the cell door slam
In this hell is where they wanna dwell more, man
Criminal antics with villains that bang clips in nang whips
No bank slips just banquets with so much food!

Mother, there's a side to me you don't know
Different to the child with the smile in your photo
Made some decisions, some wrong, some right
Now strangers call my number when I'm sleeping at night
But they're sinners too
And they'll only make me worse
Don't let me go
And roll away like a penny down a hole in a road

Bumped into the devil up at the crossroads
Searching for lost souls
Picking them up in bulk like Costco's
And whoever's written my life movie
Done gave me some plot holes
But made me sharp enough so I clocked those
The times it was too late
The penny just dropped slow
People are scared when they shoot the sheriff
But not when they shot Os
And that's how far you go
To cop those designer jeans
And it's a no-brainer when you got these mindless needs
You mix in the anger inside these teens
With no parental guidance in the script
All you'll get is violent scenes
In the community
Want them to hear opportunity knock
They can't even see the opportunity
Ain't got the eyes for it
But got the hunger into destruction, they might pour it
They can't afford the cost but who's paying the price for it
And is it all worth it
Cause at the end of day, nobody's all perfect

Mother, there's a side to me you don't know
Different to the child with the smile in your photos
Made some decisions, some wrong, some right
Now strangers call my number when I'm sleeping at night
But they're sinners too
And they'll only make me worse
Don't let (don't let) me go
And roll away like a penny down a hole in a road

But they're sinners too
But they're sinners too
But they're sinners too
But they're sinners too"
I Hope You Die in a Fire,Grand Commander,aggressive,True,474,"I've learned how to forgive

Remember

""You're not like other girls""
I’ve heard that one before

Maybe I need to get
You out my system
Easier to forget

But you never even called to
Say you were too bored to
Spend any time in my company
Took a hit right to the ego
Yeah it was a low blow
Knowing that you never wanted me

My healthy self esteem
Begins decaying
Don't let it get to me
I keep on saying

Easier said than done
Perhaps unhealthy
And also never fun
Waiting for you to want me

But you never even called to
Say you were too bored to
Spend any time in my company
Took a hit right to the ego
Yeah it was a low blow
Knowing that you never wanted me
But you never even called to
(I thought that you might have me over again)
Say you were too bored to
(After we made out I thought we could be friends)
Spend any time in my company
Took a hit right to the ego
Yeah it was a low blow
Knowing that you never wanted me

Why do I want this so bad?
I'm here again I hate this game
I should move on I know that
But my heart jumps when I hear your name

But you never even called to
Say you were too bored to
Spend any time in my company
Took a hit right to the ego
Yeah it was a low blow
Knowing that you never wanted me

Yeah you never even called to say you were too bored
To spend any time in my company darlin' I adored you
Kills me when you see my messages
Still you just ignore them
At a loss my heart's bankrupt for you

Don't need you breaking my neck
Don't need to be put up against the wall
I don't give a fuck and move on, that is all
I know it's time, I can finally confess
That I wanna live in this beautiful mess

Nobody else is paying for all of my sins

Rolling out of the club
No penny left in my pocket
It went all to the shots
I’d kill for a burger
Or a cab to ride home
I’d like to call my mom
But where the fuck is my phone

Oh my god, what do my eyes
Spot there at the parking place?
Fine curves! good shape! nice rack!
I wanna ride this impressive beauty
Every night and day
Burn all the rubbers
Better get out the way!

I’m driving in a cadillac
Cadillac
And I dont wanna give it back
Give it back
I’m driving in a cadillac

So fuck that, fuck that!
This is now my Cadillac

It’s always time for a burnout
Waiting at the McDrive
Gimme 20 chicken nuggets
And some nudes of your wife
And the night is my witness
As I drive into town
Check my new whip baby
With the V8 sound

Oh my god, what do my eyes
Spot there at the parking place
Fine curves! good shape! nice rack!
I wanna ride this impressive beauty
Every night and day
Burn all the rubbers
Better get out the way!

Final Masquerade,Linkin Park,heartbroken,True,1321,"Tearing me apart with the words you wouldn't say
And suddenly tomorrow's a moment washed away
'Cause I don't have a reason, and you don't have the time
But we both keep on waiting for something we won't find

The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
We said it was forever, but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade, the final masquerade

All I ever wanted, the secrets that you keep
All you ever wanted, the truth I couldn't speak
'Cause I can't see forgiveness, and you can't see the crime
And we both keep on waitin' for what we left behind

The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
We said it was forever, but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade

The final masquerade, the final masquerade

Another Love,Tom Odell,heartbroken,True,1425,"I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights

I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
Up

Oh
Oh

And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hand's been broken one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart

And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
Up

Oh

I wanna sing a song that'd be just ours

Your Woman,White Town,heartbroken,True,1303,"Just tell me what you've got to say to me

So cut the crap and tell me that we're through
Now I know your heart, I know your mind
You don't even know you're being unkind
So much for all your highbrow Marxist ways
Just use me up and then you walk away
Boy, you can't play me that way

Well, I guess what you say is true
I could never be the right kind of girl for you

I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman

When I saw my best friend yesterday
She said she never liked you from the start
Well, me, I wish that I could claim the same
But you always knew you held my heart
And you're such a charming, handsome man
Now I think I finally understand
Is it in your genes? I don't know
But I'll soon find out, that's for sure
Why did you play me this way?

Well, I guess what you say is true
I could never be the right kind of girl for you

I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman

Well, I guess what they say is true

In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable

We are one of a kind, irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical?
If there's love in this life we're unstoppable
No, we can't be defeated

('Cause all I know it's, all I, all I)

'Cause all I know it's 10:35
And I can feel your arms around me
Let 'em drown me
All I know it's 10:35
And I'm thankin', thankin' God you found me
That you found me
So don't you worry about tomorrow
Don't you worry (Yeah), just pass the bottle (Oh)
All I know it's 10:35
And I can feel your arms around me
Let 'em drown me (Oh-oh, oh)

It's 10:35, oh-ooh
10:35, oh-oh-oh
Know it's 10:35, oh-oh-oh
Know it's 10:35, oh-oh-oh"
Stayin’ Alive,Bee Gees,perseverance,True,2217,"Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
The music loud and the women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born

And now it's alright, it's okay
And you may look the other way
But we can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Stayin' alive
Oh, when you walk

Well now, I get low and I get high
And if I can't get either, I really try
Got the wings of Heaven on my shoes
I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose

You know it's alright, it's okay
I'll live to see another day
But we can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Stayin' alive
(Hey, yeah)

Life goin' nowhere
Somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life goin' nowhere
Somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive

Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk

Why Do I?,Bri Tolani,heartbroken,True,1114,"Messing with my head again
You had your heart set on me
But these feels they come and go
And they come so easily
Tell me what it is
About you that I can't forget
But you're breaking down my walls again
Just to set me free

Why do I, baby, why do I
Love the way you alway— always leave me
Why do I, baby, why do I
Love the touch but never love the feeling
Why do I, baby, why do I
Love the way you alway— always leave me
Why do I, baby, why do I
Love the touch but never love the feeling


Staying up when I go out
You gotta know I'm all yours
But when I say what's that about
You start slurring your words
Tell me why you have to seem so
Distant when I'm holding you
Your fingertips are drifting away
And I fucking love how it hurts

Why do I, baby, why do I
Love the way you alway— always leave me
Why do I, baby, why do I
Love the touch but never love the feeling
Why do I, baby, why do I
Love the way you alway— always leave me
Why do I, baby, why do I
Love the touch but never love the feeling
Why do I, baby, why do I
Why do I, baby, why do I
Why do I, baby, why do I
Love the touch but never love the feeling"
Died In Your Arms,Cutting Crown,heartbroken,False,0,
The Phoenix,Fall Out Boy,perseverance,True,2369,"Put on your war paint

You are a brick tied to me that's dragging me down
Strike a match and I'll burn you to the ground
We are the jack-o-lanterns in July
Setting fire to the sky
Here, here comes this rising tide so come on
(Put on your war paint)
Cross walks and crossed hearts and hope to dies
Silver clouds with grey linings

So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
One maniac at a time, we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart

Hey, young blood, doesn't it feel
Like our time is running out?
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix

Bring home the boys and scrap, scrap metal the tanks
Get hitched, make a career out of robbing banks
Because the world is just a teller and we are wearing black masks
""You broke our spirit,"" says the note we pass

So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
One maniac at a time, we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart

Hey, young blood, doesn't it feel
Like our time is running out?
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix

Put on your war paint

The war is won before it's begun
Release the doves, surrender love
The war is won before it's begun
Release the doves, surrender love
The war is won before it's begun
Release the doves, surrender love
(Wave the white flag, wave the white flag, huh!)
The war is won before it's begun
(Wave the white flag, wave the white flag, huh!)
Release the doves, surrender love
