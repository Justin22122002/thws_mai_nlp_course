Woah, oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh
Woah

I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals

I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Woah

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Woah-oh, woah
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Woah-oh, woah
I'm radioactive, radioactive

I raise my flags, dye my clothes
It's a revolution, I suppose
We're painted red to fit right in
Woah

I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Woah

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Woah-oh, woah
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Woah-oh, woah
I'm radioactive, radioactive

All systems go, the sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Woah-oh, woah

Woah-oh, woah

God is A Weapon,Falling in Reverse,aggressive,True,923,"I can't stop from spinning down the rabbit hole
The deeper that you push, the deeper I will go
They said that God's a woman, I'll worship you the same
'Cause all I do is think about saying your name in vain

You might as well marry me

My sinful confession, you're my obsession (Yeah, yeah)
If God is a woman, then God is a weapon (Yeah)

Yeah, yeah, yeah

I can't stop from sinning, my halo's just a hole
Deeper that I get inside you, the deeper you will fall
Say that God's a weapon, well, I'm a hand grenade
Try to take this ring from me, watch me detonate

You might as well bury me

My sinful confession, you'rе my obsession (Yeah, yeah)
If God is a woman, thеn God is a weapon (Yeah)

Yeah (Yeah)
Uh

My sinful confession, you're my obsession (Oh, fuck; yeah)
If God is a woman, then God is a wea—

Kein Vorbei,Ben Techny,selfdetermination,True,1076,"Gebaut, um Seelen einzuschleifen
Brennen im Takt, Uhrwerk entfacht im Schweigen
Ein System gebaut, um Seelen einzuschleifen
Stakkatoschritte, Schatten tanzen an den Wänden
Mensch zur Maschine, Sinne im Standby enden
Verbrennen im Takt, Uhrwerk entfacht im Schweigen
Ein System gebaut, um Seelen einzuschleifen
Platanen werfen Schatten wie vergessene Gesichter
Kein Weg zurück, nur Spiegel aus Geschichtenrichter
Trümmer in den Taschen, Schutt ersetzt das Gold
Gesprengte Uhren zeigen allen, dass die Zeit uns nicht holt
Beton weint unter Füßen, Stiefel schwer wie Schuld
Tropfen zählen Zeit, tickt wie ein stummer Puls
Worte fallen flach, atmen Rauch statt Luft
Wände lauschen still, Geheimnisse begraben im Schutt
Begraben im Schutt
Geheimnisse begraben im Schutt
Ein Echo hallt, durch Tunnel stumm und tief
Ein Leben, das zerbricht, das Ziel, nie erreich, nie siegt
Was bleibt, ist Staub, Erinnerung wie ein Schrei
Durch gesprungene Venen fließt die Ewigkeit vorbei
Fließt die Ewigkeit vorbei
Fließt die Ewigkeit vorbei
Kein Vorbei
Ewigkeit vorbei
Fließt die Ewigkeit vorbei"
IN MY REMAINS,Linkin Park,selfdetermination,True,1016,"Separate
Sifting through the wreckage, I can't concentrate
Searching for a message in that fear and pain
Broken down and waiting for the chance to feel alive

Now, in my remains
Are promises that never came
Set this silence free
To wash away the worst of me

Come apart
Falling in the cracks of every broken heart
Digging through the wreckage of your disregard
Sinking down and waiting for the chance to feel alive

Now, in my remains
Are promises that never came
Set this silence free
To wash away the worst of me

Like an army falling
One by one by one
Like an army falling
One by one by one
Like an army falling
One by one by one
Like an army falling
One by one by one

Now, in my remains (One by one, one by one)

Against The Wall,Jerome,perseverance,True,815,"I don't wanna drown myself
Told you I've been here before with someone else
Yeah, you call the cops 'cause I just run away
And I've been foolish 'cause I played these games
And suddenly you didn't wanna play
While I wanted to stay
You wanted to break free from all these chains
So there's nothing I could say
And I've been up against the wall
Telling you that I come
Been up against the wall
Telling you that I come
I think that I lost myself
Hold a broken heart and it can't give me help
Yeah, I fell before, when is it gonna stop?
I've been hopin' that I could find love
And suddenly you didn't wanna play
While I wanted to stay
You wanted to break free from all these chains
So there's nothing I could say
And I've been up against the wall
Telling you that I come
Been up against the wall
Telling you that I come"

Holiday,Green Day,aggressive,True,1335,"Say, hey, cha

Hear the sound of the fallin' rain
Comin' down like an Armageddon flame (Hey)
The shame, the ones who died without a name
Hear the dogs howlin' out of key
To a hymn called ""Faith and Misery"" (Hey)
And bleed, the company lost the war today

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday

Hear the drum poundin' out of time
Another protester has crossed the line (Hey)
To find the money's on the other side
Can I get another Amen? (Amen)
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday

(Hey)


(Three, four)
The representative from California has the floor

Sieg Heil to the President Gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel Towers
Who criticize your government
Bang-bang goes the broken glass, and
Kill all the fags that don't agree
Trials by fire, settin' fire
Is not a way that's meant for me
Just 'cause (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Just 'cause, because we're outlaws, yeah (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

What I Believe,Skillet,selfdetermination,True,1388,"The world around me is lost in misery
The only good I've got in my life is you
No meaning, no other reason
When everything feels wrong I feel right with you
So madly, desperate, deeply obsessed
Your love is better than mine to me
Can I have this moment forever?
Take me to the beginning

You are what I believe
I’ll live and die for you
This is all that I need
When nothing is real you are my truth
In the darkness, you shine
Can you keep me safe tonight?
When I’m down on my knees
You are what I believe

When we started whole-hearted
I never needed anything or anyone else
I was broken, you made me whole again
The only one I trusted more than myself
So madly, desperate, deeplyI will live for you completely
Can I have this moment forever?
Take me to the beginning

You are what I believe
I’ll live and die for you
This is all that I need
When nothing is real you are my truth
In the darkness, you shine
Can you keep me safe tonight?
When I’m down on my knees
You are what I believe

Believe in your love, belief in your life
Believe that you can put me back together on the inside
Chase all the fear away
Every time I speak your name
Take me, you are what I believe

You are what I believe
I’ll live and die for you
This is all that I need
When nothing is real, you are my truth
In the darkness, you shine
Can you keep me safe tonight?
When I’m down on my knees
You are what I believe"
Good In Goodbye,Catch Your Breath,heartbroken,True,1422,"The walls are closing in
Time is dragging on
You promised me forever
Forever's come and gone
You left some of your clothes
Folded in the drawer
You left me there in pieces
Lying on the floor

Where's the meaning in a heartbreak?
Where's the lesson in the loss?

Darling, through all the pain, what have we gained?
'Cause I'm still searching for silver lines
Maybe the scars you gave make me strong one day
Down the line, I guess I'm trying to find the good in goodbye

I've drawn the curtains shut
In the television glow
The promise of tomorrow
Is empty like a ghost
I found your winter coat
Tucked beneath the bed
And I can't help but wonder
If you'll come back when summer ends

Where's the meaning in a heartbreak?
Where's the lesson in the loss?

Darling, through all the pain, what have we gained?
'Cause I'm still searching for silver lines
Maybe the scars you gave make me strong one day
Down the line, I guess I'm trying to find the good in goodbye

Your love was a sunset, descending so slowly
Now suddenly, I've found myself in the dark
I'm wandering blindly, searching for signs of light
A glimpse of a spark

Darling, through all the pain, what have we gained?
'Cause I'm still searching for silver lines
Maybe the scars you gave make me strong one day
Down the line, I guess I'm trying to find the good in goodbye

High-igh-igh, ohh-oh
I guess I'm trying to find
I guess I'm trying to find the good in goodbye"
Angles On A Rampage,Sunrise Avenue,perseverance,True,1351,"It's late, too late to keep this level up much longer
We've got to turn it off or turn it down
So why do we do this?
Why do we do these things we don't wanna do at all?
And why do we do this?
Beating our heads up against the wall
I keep on driving like a crazy man without the headlights
Racing somewhere I know I shouldn't go
So why do we do this?
Why do we aim for spots we know that hurt the most?
And why do we do this? Why do we do this?

It must be the angels on a rampage
They're taking matters into their own hands
They're making us do what we don't want
Making me say I'm moving on
Must be the angels on a rampage

What kind of poison did you slip me when I wasn't looking?
What kind of hold do I have on you?
And why do we do this?
Why do we do these things we don't wanna do at all
And why do we do this?

It must be the angels on a rampage
They're taking matters into their own hands
They're making us do what we don't want
Making me say I'm moving on
Must be the angels on a rampage

Oh-oh-oh, woah, must be the angels
Why did I do this? Why did I do this?
It must be the angels on a rampage
Must be the angels on a rampage

It must be the angels on a rampage

They're making us do what we don't want
Making me say I'm moving on

(Who's gonna break these chains and lies?) Love is the answer
I gotta speak it, believe it, that's how I feel inside
I (I) can't (Can't) sit here quiet

You can take my heart, you can take my breath
When you pry it from my cold, dead chest

This is how we rise up
Heavy as a hurricane, louder than a freight train
This is how we rise up
Heart is beating faster, feels like thunder
Magic, static, call me a fanatic
It's our world, they can never have it
This is how we rise up
It's our resistance, you can't resist us

Oh, oh

(Hey) Can you hear me? (Hey) Are you listening?
Sleeping in the shadows, could be making history
(Walk) Through the fire, (Walk) on the water
Used to be a slave, but now you are a conqueror

They can take my heart, they can take my breath
When they pry it from my cold, dead chest

This is how we rise up
Heavy as a hurricane, louder than a freight train
This is how we rise up
Heart is beating faster, feels like thunder

We're rising up, up, up, up, up (Love is the answer)
Rising up, up, up, up, up
We're rising up, up, up, up, up (Love is the answer)

But she’s a vampire

When I’m playing her game

It’s like we’re middle at the first then it all can take a curve thinking I can’t do this anymore
Pull me up pull me down
Tippin then we rise
Sucking on my throat but I’m feeling pretty good though
While I’m thinking that she probably knows
I can’t let her go

Sucks all my life away

But I’m still gonna run back to her
And my friends think I’m insane but it’s so hard to explain cuz she gives me something out this world
Yeah she’s a vampire

I'm tired of bеing what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost undеr the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

And every step that I take is another mistake to you
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware

Jenny,NOTHING MORE,loneliness,True,2086,"A little sleep, a little slumber
A little folding of the hands
Left you weak, left you hungry

You're beginning to drag the ones you love down
Will this phase ever end?
A thousand arms to hold you
But you won't reach for any hands, 'cause

I don't feel like I'm getting through to you
Let me paint this clear
Life is short, my dear
See your mother here
Her last painful year
I wish you only knew
She stuck around for you

Maybe you should just fall
And leave the world and lose it all
And if that's what you need to finally see
I'll be with you through it all​

Bring on the pills, roll the dollar bill
Medicating will never heal
Relapse, rehab, repeat
Always thinking about the me, me, me
Self-destruct, spiral down
Until your want becomes your need
Please get up like I know you can
Or forever love the fall, 'cause

I don't feel like I'm getting through to you
Let me paint this clear
Life is short, my dear
See your mother here

And leave the world and lose it all (Leave the world and lose it all)
And if that's what you need to finally see
I'll be with you through it all (I'll be with you through it all)

I can't stand to see you down
Strung out, off the wagon, and unwound
But steady, steady, oh God, Jenny, Jenny
(I can't) Bear to hear the sound
Of your body, body hitting the ground
I can't stand to see you down
Strung out, off the wagon, and unwound
But steady, steady, oh God, Jenny, Jenny
I can't bear to hear the sound
Of your body, body hitting the ground

(Oh-oh-oh) There and back, yet my soul ain't sell
Kept respect up, the best, they fell
Let the rest be the tale they tell
That I was there, sayin'

In these promises broken, deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time, I finally let you go, go, go

Test my will, test my heart
Lemme tell you how the odds gonna stack up
Y'all go hard, I go smart
How's that workin' out for y'all in the back, huh?
I've seen that frustration
Been crossed and lost and told no
And I've come back unshaken
Let down and lived and let go
(Oh-oh-oh) So you can let it be known
I don't hold back, I hold my own
I can't be mapped, I can't be cloned
I can't C-flat, it ain't my tone
(Oh-oh-oh) I can't fall back, I came too far
Hold myself up and love my scars
Let the bells ring wherever they are
'Cause I was there, sayin'

In these promises broken, deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time, I finally let you go!

(Go, go)
Go, go, go

No, you can tell 'em all now
I don't back up, I don't back down
I don't fold up and I don't bow
I don't roll over, don't know how
I don't care where the enemies are
Can't be stopped, all I know, go hard
Won't forget how I got this far
For every time, sayin'

In these promises broken, deep below

So one last lie I can see through
This time, I finally let you (Let you go!) go, (Go!) go, (Go!) go

Bluten,HE/RO,loneliness,True,1352,"Selber Weg wie jeden Tag, wieder in die Hölle fahr'n (Ah, ah)
Du kommst heut bisschen später, aber eigentlich ist das eh egal (Ah, ah)
Du schaust aus dem Fenster, nur damit sie dein Gesicht nicht seh'n (Ah, ah)
Acht Milliarden Menschen, doch anschein'nd hab'n sie dich gewählt (Ah, ah)

Ganz normaler Tag, du darfst heute wieder nichts sagen
Wieder darauf hoffen, dass sie dir nicht ins Gesicht schlagen
Du wirst nie ein Teil von den'n und hast es eingeseh'n
Dass du jetzt einfach durch die Scheiße gehst
Alle schieben Blicke, aber seh'n nicht, wie verletzt du bist
Du fängst mit dem Beten an, du suchst nach dem Gegengift
Und wenn es einma' besser wird, dann wartet schon die nächste Falle
Wieder alle gegen ein'n, wieder einer gegen alle
Weitermachen, weiterlächeln, heimlich auf dem Klo verstecken
Spruch kassier'n, nicht der letzte, Klappe halten, bloß nicht petzen
Und im nächsten Augenblick
Sagst du zu dir selbst, dass du für nichts zu gebrauchen bist, traurig

Es hört nicht auf, es hört nicht auf zu bluten
Doch wenn man fragt, dann sagst du nur, dass alles gut ist
Die Welt wird grau, wenn alle anti du sind
Nein, es ist nicht fair, suchst den Weg hier raus
Du kannst nicht mehr, aber du gibst nicht auf

Du gibst nicht auf
Du gibst nicht auf (Nein, niemals)
Du gibst nicht auf
Du gibst nicht auf (Gib nicht auf, auf, auf)
Bitte gib nicht auf"

I never thought the last time I'd seen you would be the last time I'd seen you
I hopped on the bike that you gave me the day I rode to nowhere, hoping that I'd reach you
The last argument that we had, I said things I shouldn't have
I hurt you and I didn't mean to
Your coat's on the chair in my house right now

I guess at lеast you found the peace you hid
Bеneath the biggest light that we got to meet
I know you had to bury your brother

I can't tell what the fuck's going on, but I hear the tone
I fear my gut was right

Voice on the other end tryna find the words to phrase it
I know where this is going, but don't say it, just hang up
Don't say that he gave up, if this a nightmare, wake up (Wake up)
If there's only one prayer that God hears tonight, please be this
Heaven's got enough people already
So if you wanna take another soul, just don't take his
I got a kid on the way that he gotta make laugh

Und vor mir geht die letzte Kerze aus
Ich warte schon 'ne Ewigkeit
Endlich ist es jetzt so weit
Da draußen zieh'n die schwarzen Wolken auf

Irgendwann laufen wir zusamm'n

Wakin' up without a name
Open up my eyes, knowin' nothin' is the same

Poison on his lips, and his words mean nothin'
Cold like a mountaintop, father never loved him
Mama said he's bad enough times that it sunk in
Everybody out, that devil is comin'
Promise you the world, but he's always bluffin'
Before you even know it's a trap, you're stuck in

Wenn ich besinnungslos bin, dann kommst du nicht in meinen Sinn

Weil wenn ich Wahrheit sag', dann würde es unnötig deep werden (Ah)

No sleep
No sleep until I'm done with finding the answer
Won't stop
Won't stop before I find a cure for this cancer

Sometimes
I feel like goin' down, I'm so disconnected
Somehow
I know that I am haunted to be wanted

I've been watchin', I've been waitin'
In the shadows for my time
I've been searchin', I've been livin'
For tomorrows all my life

Oh-oh, oh-oh

They say
That I must learn to kill before I can feel safe
But I
I'd rather kill myself than turn into their slave

Sometimes
I feel that I should go and play with the thunder
Somehow
I just don't wanna stay and wait for a wonder

I've been watchin', I've been waitin'
In the shadows for my time
I've been searchin', I've been livin'
For tomorrows all my life

Lately, I've been walkin'
Walkin' in circles, watchin', waitin' for somethin'
Feel me, touch me, heal me, come take me higher

I've been watchin', I've been waitin'
In the shadows for my time
I've been searchin', I've been livin'

Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
Your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

You used to captivate me by your resonating light
And now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face, it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice, it chased away all the sanity in me

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along

When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

I hope everything was worth it

After the rain

It's all unfolding
Right in front of me
The ghost that I carry
Won't let go of me

I hope everything was worth it
When you look back at the end

Everything has changed
But is it what I wanted?

Say Nothing,Citizen Soldier,heartbroken,True,2413,"Where do you go when you always feel so low?
All my scars are so loud and all my friends are burned out
So, I don't let the sickness show
I know you mean well, but it’s best that I don't speak

Than ever drag you down with me

Feeling like a burden for hurting
And I don’t know why, don't know why
Feeling like a burden for hurting
And I don't know why

Where do you go when you're healing way too slow?
Cause the pressure I feel to keep it all concealed
Makes me wanna be alone
On the surface, I’m fine, but the walls are caving in
It’s a struggle, no doubt, but I'd rather shut down
Than be judged for who I am

They say: what kills us makes us stronger
The fear that pulls you under, the phantom I refuse to see (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
The lies in which you conjure, can't take this any longer
I never know, I never know, but I refuse to speak

Ich wünscht, wir könnten wieder sein, wie wir früher einmal war'n
Mit dir ohne Führerschein Richtung Mittelmeer fahr'n

Ich wünscht, wir könnten wieder sein, wie wir früher einmal war'n

Weiß, ich werd' dich wiederseh'n, wenn ich nur wüsste, wann

Von Berlin-Kreuzberg nach Italien in nur einer Nacht
Lenk' den Wagen auf die Autobahn in Richtung deiner Stadt
Über Grenze durch die Alpen, hör' 
Drei Fragezeichen
Und die Landschaft ändert sich, als wär'n es andre Jahreszeiten
Du schreibst: „Wie lang brauchst du noch?“, ich schick' dir Live-Location
Fahr' zweihundert durch den Brenner, unsre Playlist auf Rotation
So viel schon erlebt, viel Jahre spiel'n sich in mein' Kopf ab
Ohne dich fühl' ich mich arm, auch wenn ich jetzt ein Loft hab'
Lange Nacht, ich zieh' durch und seh' die erste Sonne
Frag' mich, wo ich jetzt ein'n rauchen kann und ein'n Kaffee bekomme
Morgengrauen, Ausfahrt, Autogrill, Espresso
Cali und Ciabatta, tank' den Wagen bei der Esso

Ich wünscht, wir könnten wieder sein, wie wir früher einmal war'n

Mit dir ohne Führerschein Richtung Mittelmeer fahr'n
Fenster auf und fahr' die Küste lang
Weiß, ich werd' dich wiederseh'n, wenn ich nur wüsste, wann

Bieg' ab an die Küste, seh' das Meer nach langer Zeit wieder
Deshalb fahr' ich lieber mit mein' Wagen und nehm' kein'n Flieger
Doch egal, wohin ich geh', ich vermiss' meine Stadt
Meine Freunde, meine Straße, meine Gegend, mein'n Shabab
Drive Mode: Sport Plus, Baby, ich hab's eilig
Und sie schreibt: „Fahr nicht zu schnell“, doch das ist leider unvermeidlich
Unser Leben ist verrückt, von uns sitzt keiner an ein' Schreibtisch
Mach ein'n Stopp in einer Kleinstadt, treff' ein'n Jung'n und unterhalt' mich
Aber danach direkt weiter, kann's nicht warten, dich zu seh'n
Ich bieg' ab in deine Straße, bring' den Wagen dann zum Steh'n
Unter Gucci-Sonn'nschirm lieg' ich mit dir dann am Strand
Bin am Handy, Sonn'nbrille, und schreib' mit mein' Lieferant

Shit up in my head, I been living with tryin' to cope
I burnt every bridge that would ever lead to a home
And I said I'd build 'em back like I really mean it but don't

And therapy don't work if you don't do the work
I tried but then I took the plight to paper

Save Yourself,My Darkest Days,heartbroken,True,1597,"I'm the devil's son, straight out of hell
And you're an angel with a haunted heart
If you were smart, you'd run and protect yourself
From a demon living in the dark

There's nothing to be gained
'Cause I can never change
And you can never understand my sickness
(I'll never understand my sickness)

Save yourself, from a life full of lies
And a heart full of pain and sorrow
Save yourself, from the choices I make
'Cause nothing but failure follows me
(Save yourself, save yourself)

You're the perfect drug when it hurts like hell
I've never needed anyone so much
There's no one else I love, and I curse myself
'Cause the right thing is to give you up

I'm overcome by shame
'Cause I can never change
And you can never understand my sickness
(I'll never understand my sickness)

Save yourself, from a life full of lies
And a heart full of pain and sorrow
Save yourself, from the choices I make
'Cause nothing but failure follows-
Save yourself, from a life full of lies
And a heart full of pain and sorrow
Save yourself, from the choices I make
'Cause nothing but failure follows me

You'll never understand my sickness

'Cause I don't understand my sickness

This is our church

To every owner of an orange heart
Know that nothing shall tear it apart
When the world will try to divide us
Then this music will reunite us
May the heavens be praised with our sound
As we gather on holy ground
Where the doors are open wide
For the ones that have seen the light
This is our church

This is our church

You are no longer alone
You have found a home
Let that light shine

Can we do it again?

Hurt Myself,Ekoh,loneliness,True,2894,"I can't make you pray for me now
Don't need your sympathy, I
Just want the love that I deserve
When all I do is hurt myself

And I've been tryna hide
But I know it's just a matter of time until I break down
All the stress that I hold, too much weight now (Too much)
Got the pills I don't really wanna take
But it feels like I walk in the devil's playground (Yeah)
Rain clouds in the head too often
Brain dead in the bed, that's a coffin
Havin' thoughts of the head blown off
Every time that I close my eyes, no, stop it
And I don't think that anyone get it
So I don't wanna tell anybody what's really goin' on in my head
Just wanna bе alone and listen to the music
And lеt it tell me the way I need to feel
So I don't think I'm defective
It's getting worse every day that'll pass
Getting too high, I just wait for the crash
Started when I met my dad, and then he left again
Abandonment, the only thing I expect
And can't dream when I'm in a nightmare
Everything goes wrong, what do I care?
Tryna grab happiness 'cause it's right there
But it slips through the grip, and it's gone in an instant
A misfit, insisting on always tryna fit in
Got a need for the love, but for me, I don't give shit
Enemies wanna see me fall
And I feel like I'm at the last resort about to give in

Churches start to feel like prison cells (Prison cells)
'Cause everybody'd rather judge than help (Judge than help)
I can't make you pray for me now
Don't need your sympathy, I
Just want the love that I deserve
When all I do is hurt myself

Just tell me I'm okay (Yeah)
Tell me this is life, and it'll all work out in the long run
If it's not true, lie to me
'Cause I need some hope to help me out when the heart's shut
Detached, I barely feel alive
Tell me this is all worth the pain and time
I been slippin' now, barely got the grip
Where was all the friends who said they would stick by me?
Look into my eyes, see
Right into the soul, weighed down so heavy
But I'm highly emotional but never vulnerable
The bandwidth too much
'Bout to overload or overdose, and no one close
And I got something inside
I really hate and wanna cut and let it bleed out
Hard to let in the light when there's a critic inside
That won't stop speaking up, bringing me down
I'm feeling like I'm in a battle with two different people inside of me
The one who's been trying to hold me together
Is not the one who's in the driver's seat
I got this need to escape to the point where I'm sick of my fuckin' sobriety
Losing my footing
And I wish somebody would tell me that I'll be okay if I try to be

Churches start to feel like prison cells (Prison cells)
'Cause everybody'd rather judge than help (Judge than—)
I can't make you pray for me now
Don't need your sympathy, I
Just want the love that I deserve
When all I do is hurt myself

Pray for me now
Don't need your sympathy, I
Just want the love that I deserve
When all I do is hurt myself"

Loss,Memorist,heartbroken,True,1308,"So draw me one more coffin nail; paint it in my skin
Warped and twisted like my soul, from the grief I hold within
I’ve carried this for months, still I feel guilt beneath the weight
For my mourning of a father and a son they can’t replace
More than brothers in arms
Cut from the same cloth
We’re not so different you and me
So why’d you have to leave?
It comes in waves, from day to day
For what it’s worth I’m drowning
But now it’s clear to see
There’s no such thing as happy endings
I still remember Friar Street; the crooked buildings and cobbled stone
I still visit every now and then; that place we called a home
I’ve carried this for months, still I feel guilt beneath the weight
For my mourning of a father and a son they can’t replace
I’ve buried family before, but somehow this isn’t the same
I never thought I’d live to see your final resting place
More than brothers in arms
Cut from the same cloth
We’re not so different you and me
So why’d you have to leave?
It comes in waves, from day to day
For what it’s worth I’m drowning
But now it’s clear to see
There’s no such thing as happy endings
For every rose, life hands you thorns
Not deserving of this pain, or that cold maternal scorn
I turn my head to the sky, and vow to be kind
I hope you feel this love I’m sending
There’s no happy endings"

Wenn Ich Ehrlich Bin,Liaze,loneliness,True,3119,"Wo bist du hin? Dis alles war doch mal dein Traum
Viele Sorgen und Probleme, steh'n mal wieder vor der Crowd
Wer fängt dich auf und wer holt dich wieder raus?
Und wann checkst du, dass du außer dir keinen dafür brauchst?
Die Scheiße tut nicht gut, hör endlich damit auf
Du kannst es doch tausendmal besser und das weißt du ganz genau
Lass endlich alles raus, bau dich endlich wieder auf
Bitte helf ihm, lieber Gott, er hält sich selber nicht mehr aus (Oh)

Doch ich geb' mir sehr viel Mühe, wenn ich ehrlich bin (Geb' mir Mühe)
Doch die Scheiße macht mich müde, wenn ich ehrlich bin
Verdecke meine Narben mit ei'm bisschen Farbe
Denn Opa hinterließ die Welt sehr trübe, wenn ich ehrlich bin (Sehr trübe)
Und ich fühle nur den Sand an mein'n Füßen
Denn mein Herz ist schon seit Jahren eine Wüste, wenn ich ehrlich bin (Eine Wüste)
Kill mich, wenn ich lüge, das ist keine Attitüde
Emotion'n zeig' ich nicht nur auf der Bühne, wenn ich ehrlich bin (Ich bin's leid)
Und ich will keine Fotos, wenn ich ehrlich bin
Denn ich seh' auf den Bildern immer tot aus, wenn ich ehrlich bin (Jedes Ma')
Weißer Rauch fliegt aus dem Hochhaus zu den Stern'n hin
Und meine Augen sehen wieder rot aus, wenn ich ehrlich bin
„Fang endlich an zu machen, fang doch endlich an zu hustlen“
Doch der Wichser in dem Spiegel weiß schon wieder nicht mehr, wer ich bin

Sag, wie komm' ich hier raus? (Sag, wie komm' ich hier raus?)
Denn ich bin dir ehrlich, Dicka, all dieses Sternlicht ist nicht das, was ich brauch' (Ist nicht das, was ich brauch')

Denn ich bin dir ehrlich, bin mit mir selber fertig und ich glaube, du auch (Und ich glaube, du auch)
Und ich glaube, du auch (Und ich glaube, du auch)

Ich zeig' dir keine Gefühle, wenn ich ehrlich bin
Ich glaube, dass ich lüge, wenn ich ehrlich bin
Wenn ich ehrlich bin, dann weiß ich nicht mehr, wer ich bin
Ich fühl' mich wie das Letzte nach dem ersten Drink
Ich will das, was mir nicht gehört
Die Dinge, die ich liebe, sind die, die mich zerstör'n
Ich vermisse meine Kindheit, weil es nie wieder so wird
Ich bin nur ein kleiner Mann in einem riesigen Shirt
Fast alle aus meiner Familie sterben bald
Und ich bin der Nächste, wie soll ich ehrlich sein?
Wir baden in der Sonne, aber schlafen im Schatten
Wie soll ich ehrlich sein? Ich weiß, ihr könnt die Wahrheit nicht verkraften
Schon tausendmal am Boden ohne schlechtes Gewissen
Auf der Straße reichte keiner eine Decke und Kissen
Pennen unter den Brücken, anstatt Erdbeer'n zu pflücken
Doch von hier unten fällt's dir leichter, in die Sterne zu blicken (Ey-ja)

Sag, wie komm' ich hier raus? (Sag, wie komm' ich hier raus?)
Denn ich bin dir ehrlich, Dicka, all dieses Sternlicht ist nicht das, was ich brauch' (Ist nicht das, was ich brauch')

Demonized, liquified, tranquilized, prophesied, just to hide from life
Night and day, led astray, in decay, come what may, not to face that fight

Still, my shadows follow

But never enough
It‘s almost easy
To let them fade away
But mind the goals
We want to chase

All these feelings were lost in thoughts
We forgot to live this life ourselves
How we are locked in dreams
We must break out now

Time has changed us
It‘s pushing us away
We can‘t start healing
Until we get to pay

All these feelings were lost in thoughts
We forgot to live this life ourselves
How we are locked in dreams
We must break out now

The spark is growing in us
It controls our thinking
We‘re possessed by this idea
That we can gain
Strength
From fear

All these feelings were lost in thoughts
We forgot to live this life ourselves
How we are locked in dreams
We must break out now

All these feelings were lost
And the memories were fading
The dreams i held on
Were drowned in my pain
And then
We're fading

Aftershow-Party auf Mediaspree
Im Wasser spiegelt sich die Sonne der Nacht
Billige Menschen in teuren Klamotten
Steh' nicht auf der Liste, doch komme plus acht
Dickes Buffet, Finger Food auf dem Tisch
Ich greif' zu, alles free, bisschen Fusel für mich
Die Röcke sind kurz und die Uhren sind schick
So viel Künstler sind hier, doch kein Hurensohn kifft
Im Handumdrehen wird ein Blunt gedreht
Ist schön anzusehen, ohne anzugeben
Die Anzugträger sind angeekelt
Unangenehm, ich hab' den Drang zu gehen
Zu der Hip-Hop-Party
Sie gönnen sich Koka und Jim Beam
Und alle sind so high wie Marley
Sie gönnen sich wo man auch hinsieht
An die Aufpasser: „Bitte zur Seite mit euch
Denn die Fotzen renn'n einfach vorbei“
Kanaken und Schwarze haben Hip-Hop erfunden
Doch Türsteher lässt sie nicht rein
Hast nicht dran gedacht, es ist Samstag Nacht
Dort 'ne schöne Bitch, da ein böser Blick
Du wirst angegrabscht und dumm angemacht
Du schreist in mein Ohr, doch ich höre nix
Wodka-Energy, Weed und Schweiß
Jeder Spast hier drinnen weiß wie ich heiß'

Null Garantie, dass es friedlich bleibt

Such' mir 'nen Druffi, er gibt einen aus
Jeder labert mich voll, fragt, ob ich was brauch'
Die Bässe so laut, machen einen fast taub
Sie shufflen zum Beat, schnüffeln das Weed
Laufen auf Klo, damit keiner sie sieht
Körper verschwitzt, Stimmung erhitzt
Rauche alleine, weil keiner hier kifft
Seh' diese Prima Ballerina tanzt wie eine kleine Elfe
Sie ballert eine E, aber erstmal nur die Hälfte
Du kommst gar nicht klar, gehst immer der Nase nach
Weil du weißt, dass du blasen darfst
Doch du sagst, es ist gar nicht wahr
Genieße die Freak-Show und baue 'nen Blunt, auf entspannt

Glaub mir, Bruder, nichts hält für ewig"
Für die Strasse,Bonez MC,perseverance,True,2295,"I love you with all that I am
And I need you not to understand

Komm' von Zehnertüten im Keller packen
Bisschen Brot und 'ne Kelle Paça
Ein stilles Wasser, mehr brauch' ich nicht (Eh-eh)
Jeden Text kenn' ich auswendig
Die Chromfelge fällt immer auf (Ja)
Sound brüllt laut hinterm Haus (Aha)
Von ganz unten zum Villakauf
Ruf mich an, wenn du Dinger brauchst (Brrt)
Ein Tausender da, ein Tausender hier
Ich brauch' ein'n Haufen Papier (Ja, ja)
Hör, wie der Auspuff knallt (Wrmm)
Du hast mich fasziniert
Mehr als Schule und Abitur, du hast mich akzeptiert (Ja)
So wie ich bin, du bist ein Teil von mir

I love you with all that I am
And I need you not to understand
And trying is the only way
I told you I cannot be saved

Fußballspiel'n im Käfig (Uh)
Aufm Spielplatz übten wir Drehkicks (Ja)
Die Sonne scheint auch, wenn es regnet
Aber wenn der Mond aufgeht, wird es eklig (Hörst du?)
Mein Blut, meine Tränen auf dich, weil du trägst mich, MAE-Felge, sie dreht sich
Schwarzer SL und ein'n Arsch voll Geld, dank dir weiß ich, alles ist möglich
Zwischen Haftstrafen und Waschstraßen und Seriennummern wegkratzen (Uh)
Den ganzen Hass in die Pratzen, Schatz, auf dir sind wir alle gewachsen (Alle)
Bin doch nur wegen dir auf dem Boden geblieben, weil du holst mich immer zurück (Immer)
Die Kugeln, sie warten im Clip (Ja)
Wer Hurensohn sagt, wird gefickt, haha

I love you with all that I am
And I need you not to understand
And trying is the only way
I told you I cannot be saved

Zum Gesicht wahr'n, ins Gesicht treten (Boom)
Nicht nachgeben, sondern Stich geben (Zack)
Mein Leben, eine Glückssträhne (Ja)
Doch sie disst alle und vergisst jeden
Damals mit vierzehn die Tür'n aufgemacht
Danach gedealt in der Stadt
Heute mein'n Weg als Musiker gemacht
Aber guck, wo es endet, schon wieder im Knast (Ja)
Gab dir die Jugend, du gabst mir Probleme
Auf dir ist kein Tag wie der nächste
Verhaftungen täglich und ab in den Käfig (Und ab in den Käfig)
Trotzdem fahr'n wir Mercedes (Haha)
Haken von Seite und dann eine Grade (Boom)
Auf der Straße gibt's keine Pokale
Gott sei Dank hab'n wir Schießeisen (Wah)
Digga, das ist das Street-Life (Street-Life)

I love you with all that I am
And I need you not to understand
And trying is the only way
I told you I cannot be saved

alive (it's a lie) - demo,Kyle Hume,heartbroken,True,1008,"Pictures on the wall
Swear they're all getting grayer
Don’t feel a thing at all
But no one's even aware 'cause
I just try to smile
Through all the pain
""How you been?""
""Oh I’m doing great""
But please don't
Ask me to promise
'Cause If I were honest

A lie, it's a lie
I may look happy
But I swear that I'm dying on the inside
Survive, survive
I don't know the last time I felt truly alive
I spend way too much time
Laying in my bed
'Cause I don't wanna deal with my life
Ohhh
A lie, it’s a lie
I just wanna feel alright

Sleep in
’Till afternoon
But I still wake up tired
Don't know
What else to do
I feel so uninspired and
Finding motivation never works
Every day feels a little worse
So I just pretend I’m okay
When all I want to say is

A lie, it's a lie
I may look happy
But I swear that I'm dying on the inside
Survive, survive
I don't know the last time I felt truly alive
I spend way too much time
Laying in my bed

Ohhh
A lie, it's a lie
I just wanna feel alright"

Hi, are you looking for the other side?
Feel like nothing ever seems quite right?
Are you circling the drainpipe? Getting off on pain like
You're corrupted?
I need to know where your loyalties lie
Tell me, are you gonna bark or bite?
Do you really wanna twist the knife in the belly
Of the monster?

Get the fuck up, wake the fuck up
Wipe the system and back the fuck up
You're a puppet when thеy cut your strings off
Don't come crawling back

Wipe the system and back the fuck up
You're a puppet when they cut your strings off
Don't come crawling back, you're on your own

Like a falling leaf, just waiting for the pound
Don't even bother, nothing can stop it
Tried my best, but I just can't help it
It will take a lifetime before I love again
You will see me die before I love again
Say my last goodbye
Say my last goodbye; Goodbye; Goodbye
Say my last goodbye; Goodbye; Goodbye
All the broken pieces' shattered all around me
They've been lying there since the day that you left me
I'm chanceless to fight against her;
Tried my best, but I can't break her

Gedanken kreisen überm Bett,nasskalt.,heartbroken,True,1210,"Ich gebe nicht auf, bis du meine Liebe willst
Kann das alles nicht verstehen, was ist passiert?
Will nicht, dass du gehst, weil du was in mir bewegst
Du hast einen Platz in meinem Herz belegt
Wann hört das endlich auf?
Wann kann ich zufrieden mit mir sein?
Ist das nur ein Traum, oder bin ich in der Wirklichkeit?

Leg dich in mein' Arm, du bist müde von dem Stress
Die Gedanken fliegen hoch, kreisen übеr unserm Bett
Komm wir gehеn weg — nur wir beide, du und ich
Bis du den Schmerz in dir vergisst

Bis du den Schmerz in mir vergisst
Bis du den Schmerz in mir vergisst

Deine Blicke am Morgen, wenn wir Kippen drehen
Trübe Augen, doch ich kann dich sehen
Baby, gib nicht auf, ja, die Zeit wird sich drehen
Ich bin müde von dem Schmerz und du kannst es verstehen
Schaue hoch und wir bauen uns aus Sternen ein
Blaues Schloss, wo gebrochene Herzen heilen
Damals wollten wir den selben Namen teilen
Aber heute müssen wir über die gleichen Namen weinen, ja

Leg dich in mein' Arm, du bist müde von dem Stress
Die Gedanken fliegen hoch, kreisen über unserm Bett
Komm wir gehen weg — nur wir beide, du und ich
Bis du den Schmerz in dir vergisst

Bis du den Schmerz in mir vergisst
Bis du den Schmerz in mir vergisst"

Stressing out breaking down swear that it’s not your fault I got these issues

And you’re left with the rest of me
Saying I’m sorry behind the door
Throwing up on the floor

It’s so lonely down here with me
I think I need somebody
Someone who can save me
Wishing I was not the problem
I’m falling apart

Right now I feel like a psycho
Awake with my eyes closed
Somebody save me now
Just pull me out of this cycle
Cuz I’m about to spiral
I don’t need a miracle
Just tell me I’m not alone

Heavy lies the crown that I’m wearing
And you don’t need me now that I’m a burden
So put me in the ground cause it ain’t worth it

When every turn I take keeps us apart?
I need a sunrise in the dawn
Show me what the world is running from lately

I used to see you 'round almost every day
With some other guy, hand up on your waist
And I saw the smile that was on your face
I guess I never thought that you could just replace me, erase me
But now, babe, it doesn't even phase me
I kissed you goodbye and moved on from the madness
And like a phoenix, I rose from the ashes

Lass uns feiern - RMX,K.I.Z,party,True,2493,"Schon lustig der Barfrau auf die Backen zu hauen
Sie dreht sich um ich bestelle mir den „Latte mal kauen“
Vor 10 Minuten war ich Opfer, ihr Arsch unantastbar
Doch nach dem achten Wodka hab ich endlich ein Charakter
Jetzt ist alles machbar! Los wir gehen aufs Klo Schlampe
Deine Rehaugen kleben an meiner Stoßstange
Als wär der Club eine Landstraße bei Nacht *sie ist heiß*
Ich kriege Brandblasen am Sack
Explodiere wie ein Hamster in der Mikrowelle *sie ist scharf*
Danach hab ich rasierte Bälle
Ne perfekte Samstagnacht endet immer im Knast
Ich geh' ab wie ein Kampfhund auf dem Kinderspielplatz
Wache ausgeraubt auf in der Hasenheide
Ich leide, wälze in meiner Magensäure
Jedes Mal das Gleiche: Welcher Tag ist heute?
Wenn ich weiß, wo ich bin, war die Party scheiße

Lass uns feiern man!
Der Tag ist kurz – die Nacht ist lang!
Lass uns feiern man!
Zeigen was der Alkohol so kann

Ist schon lustig wie du aussiehst wenn du traurig bist und trotzdem feierst
In deiner eigenen Kotze feierst
Eigentlich bin ich zu alt für dich und du zu betrunken
Doch jetzt bin ich schon nackt und du schon dort unten
Gib mir Schellen vor dem Spiegel nach 10 Minuten bin ich wach
Ich betrachte mein Gesicht – selten so geweint
Reiß dich zusammen man , heute ist Party
Ja, bla, ich hab' auch Probleme, gib' mir den Raki
Es ist dunkel und es stinkt nach Bong
Ich bin nicht genug besoffen – pass mir den Absinthtampon
Nackig mit der Flasche in der Hand auf dem Dach
Mein eigenen Schwanz im Mund, ich hoffe ich wird morgen nicht mehr wach

Lass uns feiern man!
Der Tag ist kurz – die Nacht ist lang!
Lass uns feiern man!
Zeigen was der Alkohol so kann

Keine Zeit für lange Party, ich lass' meine Kotze einpacken
Mit dem Blut auf dem Hemd werden die mich nicht mehr reinlassen
Ich hab keine Freunde – ich habe Komplizen
Wir hauen uns Flaschen auf den Kopf und sagen, dass wir uns lieben
Ich hab meine Prinzipien, das heißt kein Sex vor der E
Plötzlich überall Brüste ich kann den Rest nicht mehr sehen
Scheiß mal auf Kondome, jetzt mach auf die Hose
Du hast Syphilis? Baby ich bin auch nicht ohne
Triff mich vollgepisst am Flughafen – Rockstar for Life
Ich brauche keine Dusche, ich bade in Schweiß
Ich hab die Überleber, nenn mich den Überleber
Oder den Überalki
Es macht überall „ihhhhh“

Lass uns feiern man!
Der Tag ist kurz – die Nacht ist lang!
Lass uns feiern man!
Zeigen was der Alkohol so kann
Lass uns feiern man!
Der Tag ist kurz – die Nacht ist lang!
Lass uns feiern man!

And when you come back
We get up and we do it again

Though it's wrong, I don't want it to end

Counting our days now

Plötzlich ist jeder promovierter Mediziner
Doch nur Gott weiß, wann das endet, es wird nie mehr so wie früher
Schnipp' die Kippe, der Duft bleibt für 'ne Sekunde
So viel Meinungen, dass meine eigentlich eigene verstummte
Brat, sie hol'n mich, ich wart' nur auf den Tag
Guck, ich sag' dir, wie es ist, Mann, diese Welt ist am Arsch
Alles brennt ein, Staub in Massen, nix als ein Haufen Asche
Prophezeit hab' ich's in drei meiner Takte schon in 2018
Ich bin sick, was geht ab? Karma fickt mich nochmal richtig
Ich hab' Jahre so gelebt, als wenn es keinen außer mich gibt
Ihr fresst Kaviar, du brauchst mir von dei'm Abendmahl nix mitbring'n
Ich häng' lieber mit den Bratans ab mit Adana und Lipton
Attitude ist so wie Juice, schnell leben, jung sterben
Alle Legends gehen drauf, auf dem Weg eine zu werden

Wollt mein Licht erlischen, doch habt hinter Masken keine Puste
Ich bin taktisch-visioniert, ihr seid plastik-produzier'nd
Pumpen pubertier'nden Kindern laufend Kacke ins Gehirn (Yeah)
Liebt doch wen ihr wollt (Yeah), hasst doch wen ihr wollt
Aber lass es in dei'm Kopf und babbel andere nicht voll
Guck dir das doch an, Mann, ich hasse dieses Volk
Dass sich Mensch nennt und gegenseitig fickt für den Erfolg

Ich bin brain-fucked, als wär ich Stupor
Alles dreht sich, fliegt in Timelapse vorbei an mei'm Ohr
Vielleicht ist das hier auch ein Traum, ich bin gar nicht gebor'n

Je mehr politische Macht, Mann, desto mehr bist du wert
Und kannst Meinungen von Kleineren im Keim schon entfern'n (Yeah)
Und ihr redet nur von Gleichberechtigung
Guck ma', Menschen bring'n sich aufgrund von andren Meinungen selbst um
Jetzt woll'n sie, dass es Ampelfrau und nicht Ampelmännchen heißt
Doch beim Sorgerecht für Kinder wird nicht ganz gerecht geteilt
Der Punkt ist wichtig, ey, versteht mich bitte hier nicht falsch
Doch das Ausmaß führt zu weit und schneidet tief ins eigne Fleisch (Yeah)
Mit der Geißelung vom Mann schafft ihr ein'n miserabelen Feind
Doch erwirkt Gegenteiliges, wenn ihn nur eine Seite zeigt

Guck ma', wir töten uns selbst
Willkomm'n auf der Erde, hier sind Leben nix wert
Du weißt, alles für Macht, Fame, Geld

Alleine sind wir so einsam, aber gemeinsam so groß

Jeder Tod ist ein Verlust (Jeder)
Egal wer wir sind oder egal wo wir herkomm'n, yeah
Jeder Tod ist ein Verlust
Doch die Schwere wird abgewogen mit unsrer Herkunft
Es wurd schon so viel über alles hier gesagt
Jeder weiß, denn im Prinzip sind wir nichts weiter als 'ne Zahl
Nummern auf dei'm Kontoauszug zeigen, wer du warst
Dabei zählt nicht eine Tat, was du machst ist scheißegal
Für den Staat bist du ein Nichts, für den Staat bist du ein Niemand
Nur ein Opfer, das mit tausend andern steht an einem Fließband

Israel, Palästina, seh' nur Grenzdebile labern
Und auf Seiten stell'n, als wäre das das Champions-League-Finale
Fragt mich nach meiner Meinung, hab' zu sowas keine Meinung
Außer: Krieg ist immer Dreck und nur das Übel vieler Leiden
Bringen Kinder in den tot für paar Imagekapriol'n
Wegen Ländereien, Öl oder Machtdemonstration
Bin es leid, wie oft muss ich diese Kacke wiederhol'n?
Und der Sheytan macht Auge wie ein plastischer Chirurg
Pädophiler kriegt Bewährung, Vorsicht, Steuergelderhebung
Wer den Staat betrügt, geht direkt hinter Gitter ohne Klärung
Aber Bruder, ist normal, das hat 2Pac schon gesagt
Einer gewinnt im Lotto, andre hab'n kein Futter für den Tag
Wieso könn'n Krankenpfleger grad so ihre Rechnungen bezahl'n (Wieso?)
Und Politiker hab'n fünfstelligen Nettowertbetrag? (Wieso?)
So viel Fragen noch zurecht, doch die Quittung ist die gleiche
Bist du oben, trinkst du Sekt, bist du unten, frisst du Scheiße
Bist du schlau, wirst du gebraucht, bist du dumm, bist du ein Bastard
Doch dein Wert ergibt sich nicht aus Intellekt sondern Charakter
Will weg von andren Meinung'n und Bewertungen nach Raster
Bin wer ich will und was ich will, nur so wie ich und dann passt das
Kleine Kinder saufen bunten Red Bull
Renn'n dann rum mit Anfang zwanzig mit 'nem Hunderter-Puls
Junge Menschen werden Eltern, das Niveau ist genullt
Viele Probleme zuhause, draußen Probleme mit Bull'n
Guck ma', keiner vermittelt Werte, keiner vermittelt Stärke
Alle müssen gebückt geh'n, sonst landen sie im Kerker
Guck uns an, was willst du hör'n? Brauch' nix sagen zu der Klimapolitik
Guck die Nachrichten, die haben sich da selber so gefickt
Das kann doch alles nicht sein und schau' wieder rein in die Zeitung
Seh' keine Tat zur Begleichung, ich seh' nur reine Verzweiflung
Doch ich bin raus, was ich sagen kann, das wurde jetzt gesagt
Und so ist der Song wie Menschen hier: Der letzte seiner Art

Guck ma', wir töten uns selbst
Willkomm'n auf der Erde, hier sind Leben nix wert

You make my spaghetti ready
Heat up the sauce it's a dinner for one

You better hold on tight
'Cause we're rolling again
Through the wet lands down
Where the nature is plain
And when it's getting messy
I'm taking the blame
'Cause I need you to stay
On my Tekkno train

There is a whole new world
That you need to explore
It's the sound of the rail
That you love and adore
We're riding on and on
Through the valley of love
'Cause all you got is what
All you got is what I want

Destination love
P-P-Pleasure up above
You really can't stop the heat
I got lipstick on my feet
Licky, licky
Sucky, sucky
Yeah you make my lolly poppy
Candy time
Go get your dinner for one

You better go stuff your face
Before it's too late
'Cause they're standing in line
To grab a piece of the cake
And when the feast is over
We'll see us again
Next week, same time
On the Tekkno train

There is a whole new world
That you need to explore
It's the sound of the rail
That you love and adore
We're riding on and on
Through the valley of love
'Cause all you got is what

Geldscheine in mei'm glitzernden String
Ich seh' die Boys mich mit ihren Blicken verschling'n
Denn ich lass' meine Arschbacken kreisen wie Radkappen
Ja, die sind echt, Baby, das sind keine Attrappen
Gucken ja, anfassen nein, so eine bin ich nicht
Denn ich mach' das nur, damit mein Sohn seine Windeln kriegt
Weil ich nicht in der Suppenküche Schlange steh'n will
Muss ich mich wie 'ne Nutte an der Stange räkeln
Deswegen bin ich oft komplett zugekokst
Mein Traum platzte, als ich von der Balletschule flog
Doch ein warmes Bad gegen den Muskelkater
Und das Lächeln meines Sohnes, unbezahlbar

Ja, ich tanze Go-go
Du nennst mich Schlampe, soso
Ich komm' von sehr weit her
Man starrt mich an wie im Zoo

Ingo springt auf die Bühne und zerrt mich aus dem Laden
Ich hab' Angst, die Securitys prügeln ihn tot
Bitte hört auf Jungs, ich bin mit diesem Typen verlobt
Es ist mein Körper, nicht mein Geist, sei nicht eifersüchtig
Ich bin 'ne selbstbestimmte Frau, ich mach' einfach Business, yeah!

Ihr sagt, das wär gegen Gott
Doch wo sind seine Blitze? Ich lebe noch
Wenn du sagst, ich wäre eine Frau ohne Ehre
Dann sag mir doch auch, wovon ich meinen Sohn ernähre

Gib uns Respekt, sonst machen wir nicht mehr die Beine breit

Ich mach mir einen Kopf und ich rede nicht von nachdenken
Letze Nacht war ich wieder hart am Clark-Kenten
Ein Finger in der Fotze, zwei in der Steckdose
Was für eine Orgie, 12 Verletzte, 6 Tote
Darunter drei Deutsche
Du schreist die Jugend ist verroht, das waren wir bestimmt nicht alleine
Willst mir irgendwas erzählen und führst dein Kind an der Leine
Mein Schwanz wird auch hart wenn er pinkelt
Ich komm zu deim Begräbnis
Gib dem Sargträger Trinkgeld
Du siehst wie der Ziegenpeter aus
Und ich steck zu tief in deiner Frau
Wenn ich ihn rausziehe schießt mir das Blut aus den Ohren
Ich bin ein verkannter Oldschooler, wie Trooper Da Don
Auf den Bilderberg-Treffen ein beliebter Stammgast
Ich bin ein gemachter Mann, so wie Lilo Wanders
Deine Gangstergeschichten alles nur blabla
Du ziehst niemanden ab, wie Obama

In der Zirkushierarchie wärst du selbst unter den bärtigen Frauen
Wieder mal sind wir mit Schrott in den Charts
Deiner Mutter hängt die Nabelschnur nur noch ausm Arsch
Fick Nächstenliebe, ich hab Käsefüße
Nehme ein Zug aus meiner Klebstofftüte
Was guckst du? Blickkontakt verboten
Stichst mit den Mittelfinger, Hip-Hopper am Boden
Ich komme auf den U-Bahnhof und alle springen vor den Zug

Für dich gibts nur eins Alter, eins auf die Fresse
Ich bin in der Hood, es wird Kaviar verschenkt
Fliege auf den Mond und die Amiflagge brennt
Ich scheiße auf alle, Schokobrot für die Welt
Und dann ficke ich die eine von Tokio Hotel
Du bist back und ich rieche einen feuchten (Furz)
Du hast das Spinnennetz Tattoo, um die Fliegen zu verscheuchen
Deine Skier überkreuzen sich, du fällst vom Schlepplift
Während deine Frau schon mit dem Skilehrer im Bett ist
Hausverbot für dich in allen Citytoiletten
Deine Mutter ist nackig und blau, so wie Mr. Manhattan
Und die Vergleiche werden immer immer doller
Weit hergeholt wie die Kinder von Madonna
Ich guck in den Spiegel und denk mir Aboow
Den kenn ich ausm Fernsehen

Kenn' die Stage als wär'n wir Mainact

Du sagst, du kannst nicht tanzen, doch stehst dauernd im Kreis
Deine Moves erkennt man sogar locker noch vom Raucherbereich
Guck, wie du feiern kannst, ist nice
Doch wie du klammerst, hat mir Angst gemacht

Denn natürlich müssen wir darüber reden
Dass der Bundespräsident persönlich eine Veranstaltung empfiehlt, auf der Sänger gröl'n
Wie gerne sie, wörtlich: Messerkling'n in Journalistenfressen ramm'n
Wie gern sie sich an brennenden Deutschlandfahnen wärmen
Und christliche Bibeln ins Feuer hinterher werfen
Wiе gerne sie – hör'n Siе doch zu, Frau Göring-Eckardt – wie gerne sie schwangere Frau'n in den Bauch treten und sich dann an der Fehlgeburt vergehen
Das ist so gewaltverherrlichend, das ist so deutschfeindlich
Das ist so christenfeindlich (K.I.Z!)

Es sind dreißig Grad, aus dem Benz kommt Babygeplärr
Denn ich brate mir den Säugling grade medium-rare
„Ich werd' dich umbringen“ steht in meinem Tinder-Profil
Wenn ich sterbe, dann entsorgt mich auf der Mülldeponie
Ich schick' dein'n Opa (Deine Tochter, deine Schwester ins Licht)
Doch es ist schwer, richtig zu zielen, wenn der Cadillac hüpft
Ich mache zweitausend Klimmzüge
Wenn gerade keine Hassmaske da ist, schneid' ich drei Löcher in die Chipstüte
Der Bulle fällt von sei'm Polizeipferd
Weil ich es geköpft habe mit ei'm Samuraischwert
Nun das beste Wortspiel weit und breit
Ich bin kein gefror'ner See, doch ich mach' dich nach dem Einbruch kalt

Rap über Hass, das ist mein Gebiet

Gewalt ist keine Lösung und das soll sie auch nicht sein

Scheiße auf Drip, check, ich hab' Sixpack
Bullen gurgeln meinen Pisstest
Wenn du in die Crew hineinwillst
Bring mir den Kopf von Julian Reichelt
Ich mach' ein'n Drive-by währ'nd der Taxifahrt
Steig' von der Guillotine und zwei Köpfe wachsen nach
Lass' mit deiner weißen Haut meine Villa tapezier'n
Wenn ich sterbe, soll'n meine Kinder mich frittier'n
Meine weiße Flagge, sie ist in der Reinigung (K.I.Z!)
Wir machen eure Kids kaputt wie Heidi Klum
Mit frauenfeindlichem, antisemitischem Dreck
Leute denken, wir hätten was aus der Bibel gerappt

Rap über Hass, das ist mein Gebiet
Ich rappe über Hass, in fast jedem Lied
R-R-Rap über Hass, das ist mein Gebiet
Gewalt ist keine Lösung und das soll sie auch nicht sein

Ah, gegen ein Croissant und ein Käffchen
Gesteh' ich beim Verhör jeden Mord, den sie möchten
Ich wart' bei dir zuhaus und werd' dich töten wie Asbest
Demonstrier'n mit Polizeischutz ist wie Fehl'n mit Attest
Ich steppe aus dem Beichtstuhl und werf' den ersten Stein
Du findst Gewalt nicht lustig? Muss man wohl dabei gewesen sein
Nach dem Selbstmordattentat schmeiß' ich eine Ibuprofen
Ich ficke Nazis wie Sophia Loren
Trage nix außer Pumpgun unterm selbstgeschoss'nen Nerz
Flexe anormal auf Staat sein'n Nacken so wie Friedrich Merz

Du bist das Beste, was davor war, und mein ganzes Leben danach
Du machst Krieg in mei'm Kopf, doch meinem Herzen gibst du Frieden

Du bist wie Blaulicht in der Nacht, machst die ganze Nachbarschaft wach
Bin ich am nächsten Morgen nicht da, gehst du mich suchen

Und wenn ich wieder nicht rede, weil ich lügen bei dir nicht könnte
Siehst du einfach rein in mein'n Kopf, als könnten deine Blicke mich röntgen

8 Uhr Morgens - Ich sitz' auf dem Weg zur Arbeit im Bus
Les' in der BILD-Zeitung nach, was heute getan werden muss
Zeit, einzugreifen, denn das Volk fühlt sich verraten -
Ich hol' Katzen vom Baum und helf' alten Leuten über die Straße;
Reit' mit Lasso durch die Hood und nehme Kinder gefangen
Setze sie im Klassenraum ab und binde sie an;
Steh' am Kotti und schrei ""Tut was! Ihr lebt in diesem Land!""
Konfiszier' den Alk und drück' den Pennern Besen in die Hand;
Hol' das Gewehr raus und die Prostituierten kreischen:
Ihr geht nich' auf'n Strich - Hartz IV muss reichen!
Das ist Kapitalismus mit menschlichem Antlitz:
Du darfst keine Knarre tragen, bei mir ist das was anderes!
Ich halte fremden Frauen den Kopf fest und überprüf' die Jochbeine -
Sag', wer dich geschlagen hat oder du kriegst noch eine!
Wenn du zum Bürgeramt willst, musst du vorbei an mir;
Den deutschen Pass kriegst du erst, wenn du Kaiser Wilhelm salutierst!

Diese Welt ist voll mit Verrückten!
Ihr dachtet, dass es keine Helden mehr gibt?
K.I.Z. tragen Richterperücken -
Wir fahren durch dein' Block und üben Selbstjustiz!

Schluss mit Ärzten, die Skalpelle in deinem Bauch vergessen
Verbrenn' Feuerwehrmänner, wenn sie dein Haus nicht löschen
Polizei ist eine Gang - Politiker sind Mafia-Paten
Ich bin das Gesetz; Renn' vom Waffen- in den Plattenladen! 
Was and'res zu verkaufen, ist Tabu -
Im Fernsehen lachst du Bauern aus, die genauso sind wie du
Sie füttern dich mit Gammelfleisch, spritzen Drogen in's Gemüse -
Box den Ladendetektiv in die Dosenpyramide!
Ich lynche Nachbarn, weil sie unhöflich sind -
Wie oft muss ich niesen? Nie hat man mir Gesundheit gewünscht!
Ihr verpestet die Bahn mit Schweiß; verbietet mir dann, S-Bahn zu surfen
Ihr wurdet Bullen, weil ihr zu feige seid, Verbrecher zu werden
Und wollt ewiges Leben, ernährt euch von Seelen;
Überwacht mein Ghetto mit diamantbesetzten Hörgeräten
Kanaken an die Macht, wie in den Vereinigten Staaten:
Endlich kann Obama die Weißen versklaven!


Ackermann, du Arschloch - Ich zeige dich an!
Ich wähle 110, aber keiner geht ran 
Ich spreche zu euch, 5 Minuten vor dem Weltuntergang:
Bevor sie es verzocken - Holt das Geld von der Bank!
Sie wollen es von den Armen nehmen und den Reichen schenken
Wir sollen umsonst arbeiten, wie muttergefickte Heinzelmännchen
Wenn sie versuchen, mich aus dem Kiez zu verdrängen
Zünd' ich ein Auto an, um die Mieten zu senken!
Ich bin im Bundestagsklo und puste Kokain vom Spülkasten
Sie kommandier'n unsere Kinder durch sprechende Spielsachen!
Sie sind Schuld am 11. 9. und wir soll'n den Kopf hinhalten
Was können wir dafür, dass ihre Piloten besoffen in's Cockpit steigen?
Die grauen Herren machen einen Haufen Geld mit Särgen
Drucken Titten auf Plakaten, damit wir bei Autounfällen sterben!
Dann nehmen sie lachend unser Rettungspaket
Und hauen ab mit ihrem Raumschiff auf den nächsten Planet!"

NUMB,Ryan Oakes,loneliness,True,3310,"Six shots of whiskey now I'm feeling numb
I keep on running not sure what its from
No matter what I do it’s never enough
Wonder what happens if I give this up

This liquor I'm chasing got me feeling numb
This pressure is building and I might succumb
I've gone for the next step but somehow I’m stuck
I wonder what happens if I give this up

Another day another headache
Trying to figure out what to do with all the dead weight
Bottled up some problems I had and all of that led straight
To a couple of curveballs that I threw that I never set straight
I've been chasing dreams for a motherfucking decade
Damn, and it still feels like a nightmare
I don't try to bitch, homie I know life don't fight fair
I put it in a song hoping that somebody might care
Cause I put it all on the line, all of the time
And it still isn't falling in line, I call to the sky
Wonder why I'm in stalling cause I saw all the signs
That destiny was calling and I've been starting my mind
That this is all that I got, this is my motherfucking purpose
Why do I feel lost, so stuck under the surface
It's coming at a cost so I go to sleep nervous
I’m waking up angry, is this shit worth it
It’s feeling like a burden
I used to look in the mirror and see benefits
Now I'm looking in the mirror at my nemesis
That’s enough to get me pumping with adrenaline
Doc's saying I need sedatives and medicine
Anxiety and depression they've been setting in
That shit sends shivers down my skeleton
They've been knocking on my door and I might let them in

This liquor I’m chasing got me feeling numb
This pressure is building and I might succumb
I've gone for the next step but somehow I'm stuck
I wonder what happens if I give this up


Six shots of whiskey now I'm feeling numb
I keep on running not sure what its from
No matter what I do it's never enough
I wonder what happens if I give this up


Was never a bitch, that's just not in my breed
So it's bad I've eroded I'm down on my knees
Something's stealing my breath now it's harder to breathe
So I write it all down and I finally bleed
All the cuts and the wounds I collect
Been through all kinds of depths for the world to recover
I'm a martyr of sorts and that's selling it short
Now I wonder if dying in wonder
Is it better than all of the pain
'Cause there's not been a day that I haven't seen rain
Psychology states that if I stay in this state
Than I'll probably fuck up my brain
Every day waking up drained
And I was asleep but I still feel the same
I'm feeling insane, I search for the words I could never explain
Thought this life really isn't as good as they claim
I'm certain they're plotting in my head to eat me alive
It swallows me whole but it's unsatisfied
Consumed by the thoughts that I'm having to hide
They feed on the pressure, I breathe in the lies
In search for the words I'm unlikely to speak
My mouths stapled shut so I scream in my sleep
Never would of thought this was how it would be
A nightmare to live in a dream
Oakes


This liquor I'm chasing got me feeling numb
This pressure is building and I might succumb
I've gone for the next step but somehow I'm stuck
I wonder what happens if I give this up

Six shots of whiskey now I'm feeling numb
I keep on running not sure what its from
No matter what I do it's never enough
Wonder what happens if I give this up"
Papa ist in Hollywood,Bonez MC,perseverance,True,1798,"Und ich hab' kein'n Plan, was Mama dir sagt
Oder wann wir uns das nächste Mal seh'n
Doch ich weiß, meine Kleine ist stark
Und wird es früher oder später versteh'n

Ich seh', dein Licht ist noch an
Vielleicht bringt sie dich gerade jetzt ins Bett (Bett)
Lässt mich nicht an dich ran
Weil wahrscheinlich ist sie immer noch verletzt (-letzt)
Hab' so viel verpasst, du wirst acht
Und ich weiß, diese Jahre sind für immer weg (Immer weg)
Mitten in der Nacht, ich bin wach
Würd dir so gerne verraten, was dahinter steckt (-hinter steckt)

Glaub mir, es ist nicht, wie es ist
Und ich hoffe, du vermisst mich wie ich dich (Hollywood)

Und ich hab' kein'n Plan, was Mama dir sagt
Oder wann wir uns das nächste Mal seh'n
Doch ich weiß, meine Kleine ist stark
Und wird es früher oder später versteh'n
Und ja, ich glaube weiter fest an den Tag
An dem sich Mama und ich wieder versöhn'n
Doch bis dahin, wenn man dich nach mir fragt
Sag ihn'n, Papa ist in Hollywood

Wieder ein Bericht in der MOPO
Und alle stell'n dir Fragen (Fragen)
Und ich küsse dein Gesicht auf dem Foto
Damals konnt' ich dich noch tragen (Tragen)
Mit'm Fahrrad von der Schule abhol'n
Auf'm Dom oder einfach bei euch klingeln (Klingeln)
Hänge tagelang im Studio rum oder so
Vermisse deine Stimme (Stimme)

Will dich nur sehen, muss vors Gericht
Aber versteh'n tu' ich das nicht (
Nein, nein, Hollywood
)

Und ich hab' kein'n Plan, was Mama dir sagt
Oder wann wir uns das nächste Mal seh'n
Doch ich weiß, meine Kleine ist stark
Und wird es früher oder später versteh'n
Und ja, ich glaube weiter fest an den Tag
An dem sich Mama und ich wieder versöhn'n
Doch bis dahin, wenn man dich nach mir fragt
Sag ihn'n, Papa ist in Hollywood

Papa ist in Hollywood
Papa ist far away
Far away
Ba-da-ba, da-ba-ba-ba-da
Ba-da-ba, da-ba-ba-ba-da (Hollywood)"
